/*
This function uses a while loop to iterate through the characters of the input string. It
checks if the current character is a quote or double quote, and if it is, it checks if it
has an ending matching character. If it finds a match, it returns the index of the ending
character. If it does not find a match, it returns -1 to indicate that no quotes or double
quotes were found in the string.

In the main function, the input string "Hello World!" is passed to the parseQuotes
function. The function returns the index of the ending quote or double quote, which is 9
(the index of the last character in the string). The program then prints "Found quote or
double quote at index 9\n".

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string does not contain any escape
characters, such as \", \', etc. If the input string contains these characters, the
function may not work correctly.

This function works by iterating over each character in the string.
If it encounters a single quote (') and it's not currently inside double quotes,
it toggles the in_single_quote flag. If it encounters a double quote (")

If it's currently inside single or double quotes, it prints the character.
